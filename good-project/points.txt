here we are starting from the nav section , whre when we click on the buttons 
we will land on that perticuiar section , so how this is happening revive 
id + a with # (a href="#home")


the name of the website is which is my name , some letters 
which are a and p are pink in color is how we done that 

we used   - <h1><span>A</span>loke <span>P</span>ramanik</h1>


next exiciting thing is the  animation of waving  of the monu bar icon -
which is createed  using before and after elements .
remeber  : is class and :: is elements . 
and class represents a state. and :: represents an individual element . 

and that's not the only interesting thing here , look at this structuring 
<div class="nav-list">
          <div class="hamburger">
            <div class="bar"></div>
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#hero" data-after="Home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#services" data-after="Service">Services</a></li>
            <li><a href="#projects" data-after="Projects">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about" data-after="About">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact" data-after="Contact">Contact</a></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
this structuring also carries teh  reponsiveess like when the  width  decreses the 
before or after elemnt  combines and becomes another element withthe animation which was actually 
implementes theough (@ media only screen and (min/max height/width )) and when the width is not changed 
the menu-list visible and elements are vnished ..

Responsive navigation menus like this are used in websites and web applications to provide an optimal user experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.


but also on looking at everything above , a questionarises 
that waht are data-text and data-after ? 

data-text and data-after are not standard HTML attributes but are likely custom attributes used in your web development project to store additional data or configuration settings for specific elements.


The data-* global attributes form a class of attributes called custom data attributes, that allow proprietary information to be exchanged between the HTML and its DOM representation by scripts.


next when you will be looking at the website you will see  that 
an animatin would happen before the name apperas and you must be wondering how is that happend ?
well it all because of before and after elements  that we applled and 
you can also reassure that inspecting the  website ,
go to the html tab select that element and under that you will see a - ::after 




also a tip that is wehrnever you are trying to lrarn a big website 
you cen only  depend on inspect . 



and when you scroll the page the background clour of the navbar goes from transparent to black ?
how? 
remember what to do when this kind of things happen then go to the inspect tab then open the html  tab reload and then scroll 
then if you  see  that  a style of bg color is getting added to the  html tag ehrn you scroll 
then its js and if nothing chaes of the element in the htn=ml tag then you can say its because of the css . 


now when you reachesthe top you would see the img with crimson layes on ? it is created like this .


#about .col-left .about-img::after {
	content: '';
	position: absolute;
	left: -33px;
	top: 19px;
	height: 98%;
	width: 98%;
	border: 7px solid crimson;
	z-index: -1;
}
