one of the most important lessons about linear-gradient is ,
the default means the default direction the linear-gradient 
starts is upwards/180deg .
like if you do 
    background: linear-gradient(red,blue,green);

you will see red at the top , then it starts mixing colours and the grreen at the bottom . 

    background: linear-gradient(0deg,red,blue,green);
in this case the red will be on the botttom of screen ,
so its on 0deg. 

remember knowllege of directiions is very imp when it comes 
to making various gradient designs .
