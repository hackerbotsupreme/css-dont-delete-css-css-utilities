hhere ,i will start from the  range of the slidebar itself  
 as you can see what ever we are chosing on the slibar that value is getting displayed on the  left 
 so the question is how does it getting that value and the nswer is js.

like this , 
function rangeSlider(value){
          document.getElementById("rangeValue").innerHTML=value;
        }



and secondly we can see the  slider thumb is  blue and big 
so how is this like this , 
so when we tries to thonk it using usual approach the  
answer is none but its actually a part of slider itself 
so it can be accesed and manipulated using the webkit 
modile . so we can do like - > 

.range::-webkit-slider-thumb {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #00bcd4;
}

the  - Let's break down the CSS code for the range slider to clarify:

-webkit-appearance: none;: This property is used to remove the default styling provided by the browser for form elements like the range input. When you set it to "none," you're disabling the default appearance, allowing you to fully customize the element's look.

width: 20px; height: 20px; border-radius: 50%; background: #00bcd4;: These properties are used to customize the appearance of the slider thumb (the draggable part). Here's a more detailed breakdown:

width and height set the dimensions of the thumb.
border-radius: 50%; creates a circular shape for the thumb by making its corners rounded.
background: #00bcd4; sets the background color of the thumb to a specific color (#00bcd4 in this case).
So, your explanation is accurate in terms of what these CSS properties do to customize the appearance of the slider thumb. By disabling the default appearance and applying these styles, you take full control of how the thumb looks and behaves.
