
this this is crazy  how 

simple things ends up making some of the craziest thing s  
if you can figure out what tricks to pull.

here how we did it  -->
the first thing er did is make an container and as the simplelogic says 
we will need one more container with two elements one div for the element and one div for the animation 


and now think something like this  taht there are one parent container which will come from the 
-x and the child container that will come from the +x to position 0 and posiyion 0 is the same for both of them 
and when two will be at same position it will create like text reavel anumation. 

well that is exactly what it is . 

html -> 

	<div class="textRevealContainer">
		<div class="textReveal rotateY">
			<div>
				<div>
					Text Reveal Animation
					<div>
					</div>
				</div>
		



css->
/* simple confusing but exellently done man  */
/* awesome */
.textRevealContainer {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  background-color: aqua;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.5em; /*adjust according to your need*/
  text-align: center; /*in case you write multiline text*/
}

.textReveal {
  overflow: hidden;
  animation: textRevealAnim 2s ease 0.5s forwards;
}

.textReveal > div {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  transform: translateX(100%);
  border-left: 2px solid red;
  overflow: hidden;
  animation: textRevealAnim 2s ease 0.5s forwards,
    borderOpacityAnim 2s ease 0.5s forwards;
}

.textReveal > div > div {
  transform: translateX(-100%);
  animation: textRevealAnim 2s ease 0.5s forwards;
}
/* 
  textReveal has two divs under it 
  first div has the second div 
  and the second div has the thired div .

  and mind that the second div has the textt content .
 */
@keyframes textRevealAnim {
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
}







////////////////////////////////////////
what does this -.textReveal > div- means ?

The > div part is a child combinator, which means it selects a <div> element that is a direct child of an element with the class "textReveal."
In summary, -.textReveal > div- is used to select and style <div> elements that are immediate children of an element with the "textReveal" class.

////////////////////////////////////////


In summary, .textReveal > div > div is used to target and style <div> elements that are nested within a parent <div> that has the class "textReveal."

////////////////////////////////////////

so > indicating the direct child ?


Yes, you're correct. The > symbol in a CSS selector indicates the direct child relationship.
