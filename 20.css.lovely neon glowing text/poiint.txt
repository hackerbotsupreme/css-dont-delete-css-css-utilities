i dont understand why i need  : before element   to create this effect ? i was thinking if i only add   hue rotate  with animation   it will be done  but its not it .
Is the use of :before element necessary for this effect?
Yes, it's necessary.
Why is it necessary?
The :before pseudo-element is used to create the neon glowing text effect in this HTML/CSS code. Here's why it's necessary:
Background Color: The :before pseudo-element creates a full-width and full-height element with a background color of #00adff, which is a bright blue color. This colored element serves as the background against which the neon text effect will be displayed.
Mix-blend-mode: The mix-blend-mode property set to color allows the neon text to blend with the background color in a way that simulates a glowing effect. This blending mode is crucial to achieving the desired visual effect.
Animation: The animation property is applied to the :before element, which continuously changes the hue of the background color from 0 degrees to 360 degrees over a period of 10 seconds. This animation creates the dynamic, shifting color effect that resembles neon lighting.

ok i was saying  i can add bgcolor, mixblendmode , animation to  div to create effect ... sso i want  to know what is the problem with the div so that we needs a :brfore element to resolve that ?
Can you achieve the desired glowing text effect by adding bgcolor, mix-blend-mode, and animation properties to the div element directly?

No, you cannot achieve the same effect by applying these properties directly to the div element.
Why can't you achieve the effect with the div element alone?

The primary reason you can't achieve the same effect by applying these properties directly to the div element is that the div element represents the container for your content, including the text. Applying bgcolor and mix-blend-mode properties to the div would affect the entire container, including the text inside it. Here's why it's problematic:
Background Color: Applying a background color (bgcolor) directly to the div would make the entire container, including the text, have that background color. This would hide the original background color or image and wouldn't create the desired neon effect.
Mix-blend-mode: If you apply mix-blend-mode to the div, it would blend the entire container with its background color. Again, this would affect the text as well, potentially making it unreadable or distorting the effect you're trying to achieve.
Animation: While you can apply animation to the div, animating the background color of the entire container would not create the same neon text effect because the text itself wouldn't be affected by the animation.
Critical Points:

Applying these properties directly to the div would affect the entire container, including the text, and wouldn't create the isolated glowing text effect you're looking for.
The :before pseudo-element is used to create a separate layer with a colored background and blending mode, specifically for the neon text.
Summary of Real-world Applications and Approaches:

In web design, it's common to use pseudo-elements like :before to create isolated visual effects for specific elements without affecting their content.
Best Practices:

When creating complex visual effects, consider using pseudo-elements or additional HTML/CSS elements to isolate and control the visual properties of specific parts of your design, as demonstrated in this neon text effect.

ok  height , width and all its ok but there are some things that shines here -  and i need to know how these properties coming together to make the neon background effect - 
h1,p -->
filter: blur(1px);
filter: blur(0.6px);
text-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,1),
0 0 2px rgba(255,255,255,1),
0 0 4px rgba(255,255,255,1),
0 0 8px rgba(255,255,255,1),
0 0 16px rgba(255,255,255,1);

before element  of section -->
@keyframes animate{
    0%{
        
        filter: hue-rotate(0deg);
    }
    100%{
        filter: hue-rotate(360deg);
    }
}

background:#00adff ;
z-index: 1;
mix-blend-mode: color;
animation: animate 10s linear infinite;
in the background   animate is  making the neon colour change  the  color isnot   displayed   the background id black so clearly the interaction to the  shadow  ,blur and text-shadow and also i dont understand  what mix-blend-color  is actually doing , i want to understand   how the given properties   comes together to make effect 
z-index: 1;: The z-index property sets the stacking order of the :before element. Placing it above the content helps ensure that the neon glow appears over the text.
mix-blend-mode: color;: This property defines the blending mode for the :before element. Setting it to "color" blends the neon blue color with the underlying content, creating a glowing interaction between the background and the text.
animation: animate 10s linear infinite;: This property applies the "animate" keyframe animation to the :before element. It causes the background color to shift through the color spectrum continuously over a 10-second duration, creating the dynamic neon glow effect.
How These Properties Work Together:
The text properties (filter, text-shadow) applied to the h1 and p elements create a glowing effect around the text content, making it appear as if it's emitting light.
The :before pseudo-element provides a dynamic, color-shifting background with the background and mix-blend-mode properties. The keyframe animation (@keyframes animate) continuously changes the hue of this background, resulting in a neon color shift.
When the animated neon background interacts with the text, it creates the illusion of a glowing neon sign, as if the text is being lit up by the shifting background color.
In summary, these properties work together to simulate the appearance of a neon sign by combining text blurs, shadows, and a dynamic, color-shifting background. The interaction between the text and the background gives the impression of a glowing effect.

on observing the whole thing the first thing that should be coming in yr mind is  how  filter is playing out?
as i can see i already have the  text shadow and the second thing is the huerotate that will add change in the color 
then the  main question comes that is how will yu add  it to the  code ,
the context is that colour should blend with the  text-shadow  so then what are the options to do so ? 
1. you make the background hue-rotate (animation)  and blend the text-shadow with that .
2. apply the hue-rotate (animation) on that text-shadow . 


now the first on seems a little problematic but the second one 
is  look like one piece of code . 

so its , filter : hue-rotate eith animatation to keep color changin 
and also add infnite to change the color infitly over the given time period .


//////////////////////////////////////////////

so the final structure will be like - 
body
section 
div- to declare the maxwidth 
h1,p - with text-shadow with blur + plus 
p - addng different sizing 
keyframes with filter huerotate . 

but on looking on the  the code that is not it there is more 
there is section and section : before  containing the 
animation for our text , why ? 


ok , now in this case i want you to make/write the structure 
in the way you want  or you can comment the before element .
and then what you will see is   the huerotate is not working on the  
text-shado even though you have filter , and that's  why i will need  the section:before .


why ? as 
The reason the hue-rotate animation is not affecting the text-shadow is because the filter property, which includes hue-rotate, applies specifically to the content it's used on (in this case, the text itself), not on the text-shadow.

The text-shadow property doesn't directly support color animations like the color property does. Therefore, changing the color of the text using hue-rotate won't affect the color of the text-shadow.


and that why you will need to set a background and section:before does that for yu 
and it behaves like a container to text and p.


yesh so i think its done .




fiter : and how exactily does it works and what does it do ?
