what do we get to learn from here ?

this file teaches us that 
how to look into the design 
every thing that is inside the content 
not necessarily have to be 
the pseudo elements  or 
anything  we can also make designs using most simplest/basic  things
and do it in thte most simple way 

///////////////////////////////

pro tips(updating how will i use gpt from now )

first whatever we need we will search the content directly 
in mdn then we will take some taste of it 
then if we havenot found our solutions  
yet 
think about the problem once more then 
ask gpt the appropiate things to ask ..
then if that's not it  then also first 
search in the google 
then search in the communities etc etc
.
///////////////////////////////

here the design was feeling line 
it it the peudo content inside it 
but on contemplating more diversely 
it is just the content inside 
the div that is using 

  padding-top: 35%;
  and 
  opacity: 0;

and on :target 
it will become 

  opacity: 1;
  padding-top: 40%;

yeah one important thing is 
:target -- what is it ?

:target

The :target CSS pseudo-class represents a unique element (the target element) with an id matching the URL's fragment.

The :target pseudo-class can be used to highlight the portion of a page that has been linked to from a table of contents.

Yes, it's correct. The :target pseudo-class in CSS is used to style an element that is the target of a fragment identifier in the URL.

Real-world Application and Evidence:

Imagine you have a single-page website with different sections, and you want to create a navigation menu that, when clicked, scrolls to the corresponding section and highlights the selected menu item.

:target is used to style the element that corresponds to a fragment identifier in the URL, making it useful for creating single-page navigation menus and enhancing user experience in web development.

No, it's not correct. The :target pseudo-class in CSS doesn't act like a click event. Instead, it applies styles to an element that is the target of a fragment identifier in the URL.
Explanation:

When you click a link with an associated fragment identifier (e.g., <a href="#section1">Section 1</a>), it doesn't trigger a click event on the target element (e.g., <div id="section1">Content of Section 1</div>).
Instead, it changes the URL in the browser's address bar to include the fragment identifier (e.g., https://example.com/page#section1).
The :target pseudo-class comes into play by selecting and applying styles to the element with the corresponding id (in this case, id="section1").
Critical Points:

:target is a CSS selector that styles the target element based on the URL fragment identifier.
It doesn't trigger any JavaScript or perform actions like a click event.
Real-world Applications:

:target is commonly used to create single-page navigation menus where clicking a link changes the URL to scroll to a specific section and apply styles to indicate the active section.
In summary, the :target pseudo-class in CSS is used to style the element targeted by a fragment identifier in the URL but doesn't simulate a click event or trigger JavaScript actions.
