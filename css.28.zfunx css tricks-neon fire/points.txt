there are two main things here 
that are ,
1. that we can use two animations  at the 
same time . 
but more surprising than that is , 
one is covering the text-shadow (get bigger and smaller )
and 
second one is applying the huerotate of 360 deg 

and that's how the neon fire is being done .

2.we have also seen 
how to make neon effect but we 
are seeing usage of filter here ... 


that's cool
and remember the filter means we are applying 
change on the colour .
we are not mixing it .


but backdrop-filter means mixing it  .
