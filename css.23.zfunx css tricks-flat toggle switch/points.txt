plan ->
the paln here is 

first we neeed a checbox type input 
then we need a span(an inline element  as a block level element brings extra trouble ) operating 
now to create the space between the the slider button 
and the border what we will do is  m we will 
make border as the box shadow means the box-shadow is  the 
boder and how we are gonna create the gooey effect of the trasition ?

well think of it like when you make the element 
as the transition shows then when it trasitions the 
same visual effect will appaer .

so make a span pseudo element 
that will cover the whole thing then 
translateX it by half which is -30px which is -(w-h)
now why (w-h) because as yu can see the width is 60px 
and the height is 30px so i can tink of two parts 30 and 30 
which are half of the whole element means if i translateX by half 
then only half will be visible as with border redius on element and the slider container 
on it it will look like an cicle and also 
whwn clicked i will also do the the same with 
translateX but this time it will be  +30px  with lime color and shadow 
(switch on effect ) . 


and dont forget in this process we have also madr an unique 
visual effect as its unique code . and that's why i love this code .










//////////////////////////////////
input:checked + .slider:before
 we can divide these kinds of interactions in three different parts 
there are  +,space( ) and comma(,) - and yes each carries a different purpose and meaning =s  

it will be like 

input:checked + .slider:before
input:checked   .slider:before
input:checked , .slider:before


so here 
 + says  when this , this and this happens together 
   says  when this element of this 
 , says  this and this will follow this 

//////////////////////////////////

on seeing the animation the first thing that will 
catch the eye is 
1. which elements its actually consists of - convverting the input into this 
2. the slider effect ehich does not resembles anythin shadow, pseudo elements , html elements  none so 
how is it created ?






































//////////////////////////////////

the html setup is also very interesting  
like -
<div>
        <label class="switch">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="slider"></span>
        </label> Switch 2
    </div>

    here 
    div only serving to provide a blck
    the label making  as switch
    the input checkbox is on behind 
    and the span making the slider 



//////////////////////////////////

and is :before and ::before are same? or is both of them makes pseudo-element?


//////////////////////////////////

and as you have seen it the way this code 
is written is just funcking unique man  

html - >
  <div>
        <label class="switch">
            <input type="checkbox">
            <span class="slider"></span>
        </label> Switch 3
    </div>

css ->
.switch input {
  display: none;
}

.switch {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 60px; /*=w*/
  height: 30px; /*=h*/
  margin: 8px;
  transform: translateY(50%);
  position: relative;
}

.slider {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  border-radius: 30px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #777, 0 0 4px #777;
  cursor: pointer;
  border: 4px solid transparent;
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: 0.4s;
}

.slider:before {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #777;
  border-radius: 30px;
  transform: translateX(-30px); 
  /*translateX(-(w-h))*/
  transition: 0.4s;
}

input:checked + .slider:before {
  transform: translateX(30px); /*translateX(w-h)*/
  background-color: limeGreen;
}


look at this shit its fucking wnique .
