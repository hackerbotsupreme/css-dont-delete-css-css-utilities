we are is bluured background of text 
means we will apply blur but the backgound will only be blurred not the text / content of it  .


so how is it happening  
it is happening only due to ,


.blurred-bg-container .blur {
  background: inherit;
  height: 100vh; /* h */
  width: 166.667%; /* (100/cw) x 100% */
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  transform: translate(-10%, -30%); /* - [cl - (cw/2)] % ,  -[ct - (ch/2)] % */
  filter: blur(20px);
  z-index: -1;
}


and as  i said in the 
css soft glow  
if you see an blurred effect without blurring the whole 
then there is a seperate element 
that is  creating that blurred effect . 

/////////////////////////

background: inherit; - does this mean  it will take its parents background as it is including its dimensions  image all that ?

Yes, the CSS property background: inherit; means that an element will inherit its background properties, including background color, background image, and other background-related settings, from its parent element.
This property is often used when you want child elements to have a consistent background appearance with their parent elements. It ensures that the child element's background matches that of the parent without duplicating the background settings in the child's CSS rules.
