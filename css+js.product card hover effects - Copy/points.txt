first thing you will start with 
the pseudo element , 
the first thing  you will ask that why do we need the pseudo element ?
thing you will observe that the  only icon will canging to that card but the border 
and the glow effect is not changing .

so we get that the glow effect is not changing rather of effects ,
but the icon is chaging into the card and vice versa 
so as the icon is changing that is why we can not attach the shaadow to it 
and that is why we needed to make the pseudo element .
