this is one of the example of pro programming , ok .

look at this ,

not only the text-content but also the background-image with class 
we have fitted into it . 


pro tip : try to look at the designs as it is a one element 
then if you dont find anyrhing then we can think of disecting 
and thinking   each of the effect individually 
means isolating the problem before solving it . 

/////////////////////////////////////////


one thing that will surely surprise you is 
how a link is acting like its a div 

without any display property . 
but how ?

Inline Elements: By default, anchor elements (<a>) are inline elements. Inline elements do not have a height and width property, but they do have a line height. In your CSS, when you set width: 300px; and height: 300px;, you're essentially breaking away from the default inline behavior and treating the anchor elements as block-level elements, which allows you to set their height and width.

Block-level Elements: Block-level elements, like <div> or <p>, have height and width properties by default, and they typically stack on top of each other, taking up the full width of their parent container. By setting width: 300px; and height: 300px;, you're causing the anchor elements to behave like block-level elements, which is why they have the specified dimensions.

So, in summary, while anchor elements are naturally inline elements, you can use CSS to change their behavior to that of block-level elements by setting their width and height, which is why they obtain dimensions without explicitly setting the display property.

/////////////////////////////////////////

one thing that is definately worth 
noticing  is , 
where  float property is used to control all the  behaviour ?
uh, it is in the link itself .

now why its neccesary is if i would have wanted this same result/behaviour 
then the options are - display : flex  - or  - position : absolute/relative/fixed 
now what is wrong with that is  this approach needs an external conainer 
means i have to put more lines /work . 

so , this is also a pro tip (how certain property controls element differenly even if the results will look the same 
but this approach is definately very creative and unique )



/////////////////////////////////////////

important note about data- or data-text that we used for the 
text content . 

the data-text does not shows dorectly inside the element 
it have to be used with  content: attr() to access it .


///////////////////////////////////////////////////

so now i want to know when i already made an a a div then why i made  an pseudo element when showing up the contetn when hover can also be done by changin the background position so what could the reason behind making an pseudo element  instead  of  doing this ?

You're correct that changing the background position is one way to achieve the effect of showing content when hovering over an element. However, using a pseudo-element (::before or ::after) to display additional content during hover has some advantages and considerations:

1.Separation of Concerns: 
2.Layering and Z-index:
3.Complex Animations:
4.Accessibility: 
5.Consistency


In contrast, changing the background position is a simpler method but may have limitations when it comes to complex designs or animations. It also directly modifies the background, which might not be suitable if you want to preserve the original appearance of the element.

The choice between using a pseudo-element and changing the background position depends on your specific design goals and how you want to structure your CSS code. Pseudo-elements offer greater flexibility and maintainability for more elaborate designs, while direct background manipulation can be a simpler and more lightweight approach for straightforward effects.
