    when to use object fit ?
    The object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container. This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".

    The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.

You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within the element's box using the object-position property.
