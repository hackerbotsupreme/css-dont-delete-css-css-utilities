main thing here is - 
    <!-- example of offset  -->
    <!-- <div id="offsetElement"></div> -->

    <!-- this also works  -->
    <!-- <div id="top"></div>
    <a href="#top" class="scroll top">Top</a> -->

    <!-- i am impreseed  -->
    <a href="" class="scroll top">Top</a>
    <a href="#finish" class="scroll bottom">bottom</a>
    <section>
        <h1>Pure CSS Scroll to top and Bottom</h1>
        
    </section>
    <div id="finish"></div>

and what's most important here is  the syntax of the  a and link 
a href="#finish"
div id="finish"

one observation yu can make is how  a / link is interacting to div to create scroll effect ?
while  i know that the links can only interactcts withh link to travel anuwhere .
1. Can <a> links only interact with other links?

No, <a> links (anchor tags) in HTML can interact with various elements, not just other links.

but also i have to know  waht behaviour does links show when two links are on the same page is that why i am getting error on clicking any links of buttons?

i might also think  how hen i click on the top button it lands me on the  top section while it didnot have any link.
