the main thing is there is so many 
divs , but do ewe made that manually 
or do we made it using some other technique ?

well , if we see then making  this much div is 
really very hard using flex or even grid 
with maintaining it and at the same point 
adding content like emojis at the same time and make them functioning at the same time 
is the real deal .

so ,

how we made it ?

well we made it using    <div class="game"></div>

where  we will contantly be adding div using js 
and all the handling like height , width and all that goes to css 

as we can see the elements are flipping 
and when matched the show their selves permanenetly ,
so lets break it down ,

to start off we will start with the 
  transform-style: preserve-3d;(allowing the 3d style)
then we will add the the depth/z-index 
by , perspective: 500px;

and we will ,

and note that 
div + flex box creates an bbeautiful effect 
like the element has the total width with cretain size of its own .

and mix it the bacface-visibility :hidden 
makes it tooally 3d flip effect .
