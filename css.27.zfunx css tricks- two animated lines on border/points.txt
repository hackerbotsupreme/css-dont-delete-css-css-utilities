what comes in mind when you 
first  sees this effect 

it is like  a glass effect .
it can be used in so many places 
but we want to say like on bottons 
it will really shine but more important than 
that is everything is wrapped up in the a 
tag which is used for links .


so it is a good mockup/example of that 
how you can create/ttransform an a to a beutiful mirror 
effect .

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

and now how can we make it 
ok so how we make it is actually very interesting 
ok so first we will take a anchor tag/a  tag then we 
will take an div tag in it here this will contain our content 
and now we will give the a sizing,background 
and we will apply inline-block property to it 
so that we can apply box-shadow,background  property to it  
and now we will make the most 


important thing the shining line effect ,
to make it 
first will apply a linear-gradient to it 
then we will apply a background color on it which is transparent white 
then we will manipulate its position to make the  animation in future .
and we will now  increase the size  of the bacckground the purpose of doing it to make the element bigger add some help in taaking the shinny gradient out of the view .

  background-size: auto 130%;
- what is this telling me ?

"auto" for the width indicates that the background image's width should remain unchanged, preserving its original size.
"130%" for the height indicates that the background image's height should be increased to 130% of its original height.

Short summary of more real-world applications and approaches:

It's useful when you want to ensure that a background image fits the height of an element while preserving its original width, which can be particularly handy for maintaining image quality.
In responsive design, this property can be combined with media queries to adjust the background image size based on different screen sizes or device orientations.
