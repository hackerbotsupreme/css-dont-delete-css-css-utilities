the main thhing to 
understand here is how the border 
and the border colour is making this 
animation 

first , lets understand this property 
  border-color: orange transparent transparent;
what  does this mean?

the best explanation you will find in mdn hover over 
the property and click in the mdn reference .
it says , 
The border-color shorthand CSS property sets the color of an element's border.
(it says it is a shorthand property) which it 
this is a combined property of many .

ehich is Each side can be set individually using border-top-color, border-right-color, border-bottom-color, and border-left-color; or using the writing mode-aware border-block-start-color, border-block-end-color, border-inline-start-color, and border-inline-end-color.


so now if we look at the examples ,
border-color: red #32a1ce;
border-color: red yellow green transparent;

and now the next important thing is , 
how we can center this using margin auto ?
  /* we can also make it center to the scren using */
  /* position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto; */


we only knew that margin : auto can only center items horizontally 
but here its also centering element vertically .
how ? 
well the answer lies into ,
This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

    margin-top
    margin-right
    margin-bottom
    margin-left
and , 
The margin property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values. Each value is a <length>, a <percentage>, or the keyword auto. Negative values draw the element closer to its neighbors than it would be by default.

    When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides.
    When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right.
    When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom.
    When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise).

and for clarification , what margin is ?
margin is the space / extra space around the element.

Margins create extra space around an element, unlike padding, which creates extra space within an element.

Horizontal centering

To center something horizontally in modern browsers, you can use display: flex; justify-content: center;.
However, in older browsers like IE8-9 that do not support Flexible Box Layout, these are not available. In order to center an element inside its parent, use margin: 0 auto;.

and  i might think if i could also  gpt 
but the fact here is  this data is picked straight up from the  mdn official
which gives accurate documentation and exact and critical explations in one go 
but gpt can or can not give the important imformation and if you talk about 
 exact and critical explations it will definately take more than one attempt and more time 
 without clarity ,

 so its always recommendation to forst look at the mdn then try 
 asking good and articulated questions , if neccesary 
 also first look at google i mean in the reputaded and dependable sites like freecodecamp , geeksforgeeks , w3schools .
