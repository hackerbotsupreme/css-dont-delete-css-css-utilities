how you stack all elements one above another 
and but on looking from above it will look like one element/or all con=mbined onto one ?
but they are actually stacked one above another ?

you make their position absolute . 
when they are inside of same parent container .

also ,
The critical point here is that by setting the position property of these elements to "absolute" and carefully adjusting their positioning properties such as "top," "left," or "z-index," you can overlap them precisely to create the desired visual effect. While they are technically stacked, their relative positions and dimensions can be manipulated to make them seem like a single, combined element.

In real-world applications, this technique is commonly used in web design to create complex and visually appealing layouts. For example, it can be used to stack multiple images in a slideshow or to create layered effects for menus, tooltips, or pop-up elements.

Best practices include using CSS to control the positioning and dimensions of each element, ensuring they align correctly within the parent container. Experiment with different z-index values to control the stacking order, and consider responsive design principles to ensure the illusion works effectively on various screen sizes and devices.

  clip-path: circle(120% at 0% 10%);
here you will be wondering that what is x=0 and what is y=0 what is 
main axis ?
but here that's not the case 
here , 
In the context of the "clip-path" property, the x-axis values are represented as percentages where 0% corresponds to the left edge of the element, and 100% corresponds to the right edge of the element. This means that when you set an x-coordinate to 0%, it positions the reference point on the far left side of the element, and when set to 100%, it positions it on the far right side.
and same goes for y axis .
Best practices include combining x-axis and y-axis percentage values to accurately position the clipping path where you need it within the element. Experiment with different coordinate values to achieve the desired visual effect while ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.

oh give me a break ?
i have to revisit its really  too confusing .
