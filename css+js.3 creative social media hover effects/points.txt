"filter" and "backdrop-filter" are both CSS properties used to apply visual effects to elements, but they operate differently and are used for different purposes:

filter:

The "filter" property is used to apply graphical effects to an element's content, including images, text, and backgrounds.
It works by processing the element's content before it is rendered on the screen.
Common filter functions include "blur," "brightness," "contrast," "grayscale," "sepia," "saturate," and more.
Filters can be applied to create effects like blurring an image, adjusting its color saturation, or applying other image processing operations.
The "filter" property affects the entire element and its contents.
Example:

css
Copy code
.element {
  filter: blur(5px) grayscale(50%);
}
backdrop-filter:

The "backdrop-filter" property is used to apply graphical effects to the area behind an element, affecting what's visible through the element.
It works by processing the elements that are rendered below the current element in the stacking order, not the element itself.
Common backdrop-filter functions include "blur," "brightness," "contrast," "grayscale," and others, similar to "filter."
"backdrop-filter" is often used to create effects like blurring the content behind a transparent or semi-transparent element, creating frosted glass or glass-like effects.
Example:

css
Copy code
.element {
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px) brightness(120%);
}
In summary, "filter" directly affects the appearance of the element and its contents, while "backdrop-filter" affects what's visible behind the element. The choice between them depends on the specific visual effect you want to achieve in your design.

The CSS property box-shadow is used to add one or more shadow effects to an element. In your provided code, there are three shadow effects applied to the element, and each is separated by a comma. Here's a breakdown of each part of the box-shadow property:

First Shadow:

0 0 0 10px var(--clr)
This creates a shadow with the following characteristics:
No horizontal offset (0).
No vertical offset (0).
No blur radius (0).
A spread radius of 10px.
The color of the shadow is determined by a CSS custom property (var(--clr)).
Second Shadow:

0 0 0 20px var(--bg)
This creates a second shadow effect with the following properties:
No horizontal offset (0).
No vertical offset (0).
No blur radius (0).
A spread radius of 20px.
The color of this shadow is determined by another CSS custom property (var(--bg)).
Third Shadow:

0 0 0 22px var(--clr)
This is the third shadow effect with these properties:
No horizontal offset (0).
No vertical offset (0).
No blur radius (0).
A spread radius of 22px.
The color is once again determined by the first CSS custom property (var(--clr)).
