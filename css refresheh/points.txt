16>
First Child Pseudo-selector

18>
Last Child Pseudo-selector
Select the last element inside of another element
:last-child
You can use this selector to select an element that is the last child element inside of another element.

Pro Tip â†’ In cases where there is only one element, that element counts as the first-child, only-child and last-child!
Examples
:last-child selects all last-child elements.
span:last-child selects all last-child span elements.
ul li:last-child selects the last li elements inside of any ul.

Select the small apple and the pickle
.small:last-child

Examples
span:nth-of-type(6n+2) selects every 6th instance of a span, starting from (and including) the second instance.


Select every 2nd plate, starting from the 3rd
:nth-of-type(2n+3)
