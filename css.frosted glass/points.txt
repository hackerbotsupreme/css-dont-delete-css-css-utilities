//////////////////////////////////////
backdrop-filter

The backdrop-filter CSS property lets you apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the area behind an element. Because it applies to everything behind the element, to see the effect you must make the element or its background at least partially transparent.

backdrop-filter: sepia(90%);
backdrop-filter: invert(80%);

The backdrop-filter property in CSS is used to apply filter effects (grayscale, contrast, blur, etc) to the background/backdrop of an element. The backdrop-filter has the same effect as the filter property,

can be any one of the following:

    blur()
    brightness()
    contrast()
    drop-shadow()
    grayscale()
    hue-rotate()
    invert()
    opacity()
    saturate()
    sepia()
    url() â€“ (for applying SVG filters)
