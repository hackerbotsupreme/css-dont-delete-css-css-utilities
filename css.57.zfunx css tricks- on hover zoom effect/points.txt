here 
we are trying to make are 
trying to make a changing colour gradient 
on the screen 
but how will we make it 

well the first thing we need is the canvas 
to create a linear gradient  on 

and here we needed an initial colour so are gonna make a second canvas to give a fixed colour .
then we need need a hue rotate on it to change the colour constantly .


but i dont understand why the background size of the background is 400%?
and also why do we need to change the background position constantly?
