now , will you belive what what ever you are seeing here 
that is made only with linear-gradoent 

this just diesplays how much we can really do if we 
master this and that is the real eassence of this 
project . 


  background-image: linear-gradient(
      80deg,

      rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8) 62%,
      rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) 62%,
      transparent
    ),

look at this this is all it took to made ,

so lets explain it a little more 

It starts with a 80-degree angle gradient.
It begins with a semi-transparent white color (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)).
At 60%, it transitions to a semi-transparent black color (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)).
At 61%, it transitions to a slightly less transparent black (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)).
At 61%, it transitions back to semi-transparent white.
Finally, at 62%, it transitions to semi-transparent black again, creating a visually interesting pattern.


what does it mean by -At 60%
ChatGPT
At 60% means that in the linear gradient defined by linear-gradient(80deg, ...) in your CSS code, a color transition occurs at the point where the gradient has progressed 60% of its distance.

In the provided CSS linear-gradient, there are color stops defined at various points along the gradient line.


When you specify 60% as a color stop, it means that at the point where the gradient has covered 60% of its length from the starting point (usually the top or left side, depending on the angle), a color transition will occur.

Critical Points:

The percentage values in gradient color stops allow you to precisely control where color transitions occur in a linear gradient.
It's a way to create smooth and visually appealing transitions between colors in the background gradient.
In summary, "At 60%" means that in the linear gradient, there's a color transition occurring at the point where the gradient has reached 60% of its length from the starting point, which is defined by the linear-gradient function in your CSS.
