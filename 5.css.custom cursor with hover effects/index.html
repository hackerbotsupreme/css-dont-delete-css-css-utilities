<!-- The section element in your HTML code has been styled to cover the entire viewport (100% width and 100vh height) using CSS. The reason behind this behavior is to create a full-page background for the custom cursor and hover effects you've defined inside the section. -->
<!-- Covering the entire viewport with a section like this is often used to create visually striking effects, such as full-page backgrounds or overlays. -->
<!-- It can be particularly useful when you want to create an immersive user experience or when you need to overlay content on top of a background. -->
