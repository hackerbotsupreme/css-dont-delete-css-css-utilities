here i will start with ,
the background color of the button 
which half blue and half is darkblue 
but more important is there is a  a distinct line between 
two colours  ,

now i know yu will first think about the 
liner-gradient but this is the drawback of linear gradient that 
you can not create a dintict line between the colrs and yu can not control 
how much area wil be accupied by one color 
and thats why gradiet will not work on it .

so what the other options could be ?
the other op tion could be to make a element blue in color  of the same back size and 
then replace its half in the -x  with overflow hidden , 
but who can be that element  well we already have some clue 
where it should be? in back ground so the element should be inline also 
so that it does not creates unneccesary issues 
. 
so the options are , span , i etc.

with span  you can do absolute positioning 
then you add linear gradient (as a bcakground) width will be 2px 
and add animation delay and animation to it  with proper timing .
