ok , we will start with the 
layers here  see this 
		<div class="open">
			<div class="layer"></div>
			<div class="layer"></div>
		</div>
.open
{
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	pointer-events: none;
	z-index: 10000;
}
here first thing of the 
revice is position fixed where we fixes the elements relative to the screen 
and remember 
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0; this comes togehter .
    but is it neccesary to write like this ?
    cant we write like 
    position : fixed 
    height: 100vh;
    width : 100% ? 
Yes, it's correct to use position: fixed; along with top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; to create a fixed element that covers the entire viewport.

However, you can also achieve the same result with position: fixed; height: 100vh; width: 100%;.

Critical points:

Both approaches achieve the same visual result, i.e., a fixed element covering the entire viewport.
Using height: 100vh; and width: 100%; is more explicit and easier to understand.
The first approach (top, left, right, bottom) might be useful when you need to set additional properties like padding or margins relative to the viewport edges.
Real-world applications and approaches:

The choice between the two methods often depends on the specific design requirements of your web project.
Using height: 100vh; and width: 100%; is more in line with modern CSS practices and is easier for developers to maintain and read.
Best practices:

It's generally recommended to use the height: 100vh; and width: 100%; approach for simplicity and clarity unless you have specific reasons to use top, left, right, and bottom properties.




//////////////////

.open .layer
{
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	transform-origin: top;
	animation: open 1s ease-in-out forwards;
}
why we needed transform origin: top in here ?

the thing is when the animation starts you will see the slides are closing from  bottom to top 
now imagine the top (line) is the center so then  it all makes sense .



///////////////////////////



but the question still remains that how the whole animaation is happening ?

well its because of this , 
.open
{
	position: fixed;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	pointer-events: none;
	z-index: 10000;
}
.open .layer
{
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	transform-origin: top;
	animation: open 1s ease-in-out forwards;
}
.open .layer:nth-child(1)
{
	background: #000;
	z-index: 2;
}
.open .layer:nth-child(2)
{
	background: #03a9f4;
	animation-delay: 1s;
	z-index: 1;
}
@keyframes open
{
	0%
	{
		transform: scaleY(1);
	}
	100%
	{
		transform: scaleY(0);
	}
}
in words , 
first 
the slider is  coming from bottom to top 
or in ther words we can say the nimation is happening from the 
bottom to top which is the  y axis and it is expanding so its 
scaling so it will be like , scaleY (1) and scale is a transform value so 
		transform: scaleY(1);

with this it will scale up but where it would do ?
it would do it in the open div
and what is forwards is doing in the animation ?
"forwards" in CSS animations means that after the animation finishes, the element will stay in the final state that the animation reached.

In your animation, you are using "transform" to make the element scale down ("transform: scaleY(0);"). Without "forwards," after the animation completes, the element would snap back to its original size.

However, with "forwards," it ensures that the element remains scaled down (in its final state) even after the animation is done. So, it stays hidden as intended.

In summary, "forwards" is like saying, "Hey, CSS, keep this element in the state it reached after the animation ends," which is useful for creating various visual effects.

Best practice: When you want to maintain the final state of an animation, use "forwards" in your animation properties.

and look at the addressers 
.open .layer
.open .layer:nth-child(1)
.open .layer:nth-child(2)
and keep in mind the animation is being applid  to the  .open .layer
in words this is saying the  layers will follow the  animation but the 
nth childs means .open .layer:nth-child(1)
.open .layer:nth-child(2) - will decide their initial states. 

and then the animation and then the attributes  are getting combined to it .
and the animation in words , 
important information ,
However, in the @keyframes animation section, you are using transform: scaleY(0);, which scales the element vertically along its central axis.

When you set the scale to 0 vertically, it effectively collapses the element, making it disappear from the bottom to the top, even though the transform origin is at the top edge.

and it is (dirction is important ) beacuse the  animation we will see should be happening in the  bottom to top .
in shory scale y shorts/shrinks the element from top to bottom, and the scale X does it in from left to right.
and on top of it and with this explanation yu can thinl 
if scale y is expanig  elements from the bottom to top why we neeed transform origin top ? what is it really doing in the code ?

its a good and valid question ,
okay you know that  scale shrinks element from top to bottom to center and vice versa when it will expand  from center 
or the origin so normally if  you remove 
	transform-origin: top;
you will see that the center / origin of y asis is the center of fthe screen so 
when  yu applying tat it create create an effect of bottom to top animation and 
vice versa when you apply bottom to it .
so 
You are absolutely correct, and I appreciate your patience in explaining this further. Let's clarify:

By default, when you use transform: scaleY(value); without specifying transform-origin, it scales the element along its central vertical axis. This means it shrinks or expands the element symmetrically from its center.

When you add transform-origin: top;, you are explicitly setting the reference point for the vertical scaling operation to be at the top of the element.

If you remove transform-origin: top;, the origin remains at the center of the element along the vertical axis. In this case:

Scaling with transform: scaleY(0); would indeed appear as if the element is collapsing from its center both upwards and downwards.
Scaling with transform: scaleY(1); would maintain the element's original size.
So, you are correct that transform-origin: top; creates an effect where the element appears to collapse from the top to the bottom. Thank you for pointing out the clarification.


but also , what does - transform origin : top - is doing explain me in simple words with a simple defination?

/////////////////////////////////////////

and following this  

look at this  ,


first , 
.bannerText h2:before,
.bannerText h3:before
{
		transform-origin: right;
	animation: revealText 1s ease-in-out forwards;
}
@keyframes revealText
{
	0%
	{
		transform: scaleX(1);
	}
	100%
	{
		transform: scaleX(0);
	}
}

second(then),
.bannerText h2,
.bannerText h3
{
	text-transform: uppercase;
	transform-origin: left;
	transform: scaleX(0);
	animation: revealTextReverse 1s ease-in-out forwards;
}
@keyframes revealTextReverse
{
	0%
	{
		transform: scaleX(0);
	}
	100%
	{
		transform: scaleX(1);
	}
}


revise , the animation(revealText)  will  start towards  the origin(right)  and will stay as same as its 100%
then , the text which waas at scale 0 will start  towards  the origin(left) and also   stay as same as its 100%.
in short , transform-origin + transform + animation . is making it .



//////////////////////////////

the next thing is 

the postioning of the bulb ,

look at this , 
.bulb
{
	opacity: 0;
	position: absolute;
	right: 10%;
	top: 50%;
	transform: translateY(-50%);
	animation: fadeIn 1s linear forwards;
	animation-delay: 6s;
	z-index: 100;
}

now look at this  ,
	top: 50%;
	transform: translateY(-50%);
first 10 %  from the rigth then  50% from the top then  -50% fromthe  y axis which makes element 
center vertically . 





//////////////////////////////


whenever you see an element puhed outside of the frame then 
the first thing that should comes to your mind is that element has 
a negative positioning 
like
top :-40/-100 px
bottom :-40/-100 px
left :-40/-100 px
right :-40/-100 px

disclaimer the inset cennot have  a -ve value

///////////////////////////////////////////////


now , for practice ,
look at this 

0%
	{
		transform: translateX(150px);
		opacity: 0;
	}
	100%
	{
		transform: translateX(0);
		opacity: 1;
	}

it is saying 
at  0 % it will be at 150px along the x axis but at the 100% it will  be at 0px .
which will be creating that the text is coming from the right sliding .
