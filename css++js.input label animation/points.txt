the main thing you will be thinking heere 
is , 
how the input box 
and i are meged one onto  another to create such 
design ,

so first what we have to do is 
undress the default design of the input like 
  position: relative;
  padding: 8px 10px;
  width: 100%;
  border: none;
  outline: none;
  background: transparent;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 1.25em;
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;
  z-index: 2;
and then add the i or html element or pseudo wlwmwnt 
accorading to your design requirements 
like 

    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 3px;
    background: linear-gradient(45deg, #2196f3, #ff4685);
    transition: 0.5s;
    z-index: 1;
    border-radius: 4px;
    pointer-events: none;

and lastly , 
wwhat is ~ in  .container .inputBox input:valid ~ i?

In the CSS selector ".container .inputBox input:valid ~ i," the tilde (~) symbol represents the general sibling combinator. It selects elements that are siblings of the preceding element and share the same parent.
source mdn 
The general sibling combinator (~) separates two selectors and matches all iterations of the second element, that are following the first element (though not necessarily immediately), and are children of the same parent element.

Syntax

css

/* The white space around the ~ combinator is optional but recommended. */
former_element ~ target_element { style properties }
css

p ~ span {
  color: red;
}







The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent
