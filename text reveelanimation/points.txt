plan to create it  -- > 


first we seen that the way the animation is happenning we can easily  say our container  is the  div and 
it will have text with the  span to make that animation ,

secondly for the confusion that it does not matter that where the span is placed whether in front of  text or not it does not matter .

thirly , we need to add width : fit-content to create the boundary for the animation .


the most crucial effect here is the timng , 
look at this 
all the div/h1 that contains the text 

  animation-delay: 0.5s;
  but for first text ,
    animation-delay: 0.5s;


  but for second  text ,
  animation-delay: 1.5s;

  but for third text ,
  animation-delay: 2.5s;

all main animation that will happen before the  text ,

for every span {
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
}
#hero h1:nth-child(1) span {
  animation-delay: 0.5s;
}
#hero h1:nth-child(2) span {
  animation-delay: 1.5s;
}
#hero h1:nth-child(3) span {
  animation-delay: 2.5s;
}


see and 


also we will use  three kinds of animation like -
h1 - text_reveal 
h1:nth-child(3) -text_reveal_name
span - text_reveal_box


the animations are - > 

first --                             animation-delay->
span - text_reveal_box
@keyframes text_reveal_box {              0.5s;+0.5s;==>1s
  50% {                                   0.5s;+1.5s;==>2s 
    width: 100%;                          0.5s;+2.5s;==>3s         
    left: 0;
  }
  100% {
    width: 0;                             (differece between span 
    left: 100%;                           and h1 animations are 1s)
  }
}

second--                            animation-delay->
h1 - text_reveal                         1s;+1s;==>2s
@keyframes text_reveal {                 1s;+2s;==>3s
  100% {                                 1s;+3s;==>4s
    color: white;
  }
}


last --
h1:nth-child(3) -text_reveal_name
@keyframes text_reveal_name {
  100% {
    color: crimson;
    font-weight: 500;
  }
}


and lastly but most importantly put forwards for the animation  so that hte elements are stayes same 
as the animation finished .

refined version of plan --> 
Plan to Create a Captivating Text Animation:

1. Container Identification:

Begin by identifying the container responsible for housing the text animation. In this case, it's the <div> within the <section id="hero">.
2. Span Placement Flexibility:

Recognize that the placement of the <span> elements, whether within or in front of the text, does not impact the animation's functionality.
3. Establishing Text Boundaries:

Ensure that the text has a defined boundary for the animation by setting width: fit-content.
4. Precision in Timing:

Highlight the critical timing aspect of the animation, denoted by animation-delay.
Clarify that each <h1> element containing text has distinct animation-delay values:
First text: animation-delay: 0.5s;
Second text: animation-delay: 1.5s;
Third text: animation-delay: 2.5s;
Emphasize that each <span> element within the text employs animation-delay: 0.5s;.
Illustrate how this meticulous timing orchestration achieves the desired sequential animations.
5. Animation Categories:

Categorize the three primary animation types employed:
For <h1> elements: text_reveal
Specifically for the third <h1> element: text_reveal_name
For all <span> elements: text_reveal_box
6. In-Depth Animation Breakdown:

Provide detailed insights into the keyframes and animation specifications:
text_reveal_box animation:
Duration: 1s
Individual Delays: 0.5s, 1.5s, 2.5s (corresponding to each <span>)
text_reveal animation:
Duration: 3s
Delays: 1s, 2s, 3s (associated with each <h1>)
text_reveal_name animation:
Duration: 3s
Delay: 3s (attributed to the third <h1>)
7. Animation Completion Assurance:

Stress the significance of utilizing animation-fill-mode: forwards to ensure that elements retain their final state once the animation concludes.
This refined plan offers a comprehensive blueprint for executing the text animation. It not only clarifies the animation structure and timing but also underscores the meticulous orchestration of animation delays and their role in creating a captivating sequence. This plan serves as a valuable guide for successfully implementing the desired text animation

best  inline html elements to make the efects ?

The best inline HTML elements for creating effects are <span>, <a>, and <i>.

now why ?
<span>: This versatile inline element allows you to apply CSS styles and JavaScript effects directly to a specific part of the text within a block element. For example, you can use it to highlight specific words in a paragraph, create tooltips, or change text color dynamically when interacting with a web page.

<a>: The anchor tag is primarily used for creating hyperlinks, but it can also be styled and scripted to create various effects. For instance, you can change the appearance of links on hover or use JavaScript to trigger animations when a user clicks on a link.

<i>: The <i> tag is typically used for italicizing text, but it's often repurposed with CSS to create decorative icons or font-based animations. FontAwesome is a popular library that uses the <i> tag to display scalable vector icons.


and the most important thing why we chose span element here ?  when we also had the options  like a and i here ?

first thing is  that we are dealing with text so that mean that element that should be compatible with text.
second , <span> elements in your HTML for text effects is a suitable choice because they are versatile inline elements that can be easily styled and manipulated 
third,<span> elements are generic inline containers that don't have any predefined meaning, which makes them ideal for custom styling and scripting. They act as a blank canvas for your creativity.
lastly  ,In conclusion, <span> elements were chosen in your code because they are flexible, semantic, and well-suited for creating custom text effects without compromising the integrity of your HTML. They provide a blank canvas for your styling and scripting creativity while adhering to best practices for HTML semantics and user experience.

//////////////////////////
Moment of Realization:
Imagine we're about to embark on an animation journey with our <h1> elements, but we encounter a challenge. The <h1> tag, which holds our precious text, lacks certain vital properties like width or height needed to breathe life into our animations.

Solution Unveiled:
In this critical juncture, we introduce the magic of width: fit-content;. This CSS declaration elegantly addresses our need. It gracefully bestows a defined width upon our content, yet with a twist â€“ it restrains this width to embrace the natural dimensions of the content it encases.

In Practical Terms:
Consider it as a tailor measuring and crafting a bespoke suit, perfectly tailored to the wearer's physique. Similarly, width: fit-content; tailors our container to snugly fit the text it holds, creating an ideal stage for our animations to shine. It's the subtle touch that sets the stage for a captivating performance.

why we need disply : block with h1?

1. Answer:
We use display: block; with <h1> elements to ensure they behave as block-level elements, allowing us to control their layout, spacing, and alignment within the document flow effectively.

2. Reason with Real World Application and Evidence:
Imagine <h1> elements as elegant titles in a book. By default, HTML elements like <h1> are inline-level elements, which means they flow within the text, not creating distinct blocks.
However, when we apply display: block; to <h1>, we transform them into block-level elements. This CSS declaration fundamentally changes their behavior. Here's why it matters:
Layout Control: Block-level elements start on a new line and occupy the full width of their parent container. This allows us to control the positioning of <h1> within the layout, ensuring they don't overlap with other content.
Spacing: Block-level elements come with default top and bottom margins. These margins can be adjusted, providing us with precise control over the spacing between elements.
Alignment: We can easily center-align or adjust the alignment of block-level elements within their parent containers, ensuring a visually appealing and balanced layout.

3. Critical Points:

Block-level elements are suitable for creating distinct sections or headers within a webpage, making them stand out and structuring content effectively.
Block-level elements naturally provide a clear separation between content, making it easier for both designers and developers to work with.

ease : 
starts slowly, accelerates sharply, and then slows gradually towards the end. This keyword represents the easing function in mdn .

ease-in
starts slowly, then progressively speeds up until the end, at which point it stops abruptly. 


ease-out
starts abruptly and then progressively slows down towards the end. 


ease-in-out
starts slowly, speeds up, and then slows down towards the end.
At the beginning, it behaves like the ease-in keyword; at the end, it is like the ease-out keyword.
