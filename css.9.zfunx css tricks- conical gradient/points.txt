first  we will try to get an idea what is 
tell me how conical-gradient works ?

A conical gradient is a type of CSS gradient that creates a circular gradient pattern, radiating from a central point outward in all directions. It simulates the appearance of a color wheel or a cone-shaped gradient.

example  -
background: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);

and revise  what things we learned  , 
we larened about  , 
1.linear-gradient (makes gradient in linear )
1.conic-gradient (makes gradient in circular )
1.radial-gradient (makes gradient in wavy like starts from the center   )
///////////////////////////////////


the first thing that will catch your eyes on 
looking on the code is ,

this , 

.conical-grad:before,
.conical-grad:after {
  position: absolute;
  content: "";
  top: 0;
  bottom: 50%;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, hsl(0, 100%, 50%) 50%, transparent 50%),
    linear-gradient(90deg, hsl(45, 100%, 50%) 50%, transparent 50%),
    linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(90, 100%, 50%) 50%, transparent 50%),
    linear-gradient(180deg, hsl(135, 100%, 50%) 50%, transparent 50%);
  background-size: 200px 200px;
}

.conical-grad:after {
  bottom: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, transparent 50%, hsl(180, 100%, 50%) 50%),
    linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 50%, hsl(225, 100%, 50%) 50%),
    linear-gradient(135deg, transparent 50%, hsl(270, 100%, 50%) 50%),
    linear-gradient(180deg, transparent 50%, hsl(315, 100%, 50%) 50%);
  z-index: -1;
}


the first thing that is here is creation of pseudo elements ,
so ehy would i need pseudo elements to apply the conical gradient ?














//////////////////////////////////


and secondly why would i need to use linear gradient for cubic-gradient ?


//////////////////////////////////

thirdly how the container has a height and width 
is it because of its child inside it that has height and width?
yes . The container div does not have an explicit height and width defined in its CSS, but it appears to have a height and width because of its child element, the conical-grad div.



//////////////////////////////////
fourth thing is the whole toic of this code is making cinicgradient but in the code there is not even one conic gradient 
there is only linear-gradient .
if you want to know about the conicgradient then 
search  conic-gradient  mdn .
