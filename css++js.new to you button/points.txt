
i always told you 
put design into wordds then into css and html
make the html more simple it matters most .
think about the most optimized approach with the html then connect all with css 
and mdn , web, gpt is always there 

the main thing is how 
the html is simply brilliant ,

which 
is 
    <a href="#"><span>New To You</span></a>

also revice what element with pseudo 
eement offers is simple html + most flexibility and control 
but the disadvantage is you have to be more than careful 
when using this , you got to be the eexact  thing in your mind ok.
 then  for css ,
 we wonder why we needed  pseudo elements here ?

now if yu were thinking  that you will make the 
span an inset element 
by making that a block element but as you see 
  /* display: block;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  top: 0px;
  right: 0px;
  bottom: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  inset: 1px;
  background: #272727; 
this will not work because  the a 
tag doesnot have set it's width and height we 
only added padding which is his and not heigth and width

and 
when it comes to  
  top: 0px;
  right: 0px;
  bottom: 0px;
  left: 0px;
  inset: 1px;
this 
it will not work as expected 
bcz 
Specifies how far an absolutely positioned box's right margin edge is offset to the left of the right edge of the box's 'containing block'.
so it has to be absolutely positioned to follow this 
and 
that is why we needed to 
make the before 
and after for the glow effect  

but how do we make it / what will be our approach ?

so on hover we can see blur with linear-gradient 

so with all it should look like 

a::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0px;
  border-radius: 9px;
  transition: 0.5s;
  background: linear-gradient(45deg, #3394d4, #69007f, #fc0987);
  opacity: 0;
  filter: blur(20px);
}
