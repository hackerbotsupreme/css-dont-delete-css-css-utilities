on looking on the  html ,
the first question that comes is  
why the span is used to contain the pictures ? 

prompt 

i still dont understand what could be the secifc criterias that the span is covering  as a img holder.....why is it preffered here ?


ans 

I understand your confusion. In the provided HTML and CSS code, the use of <span> elements to hold images within the 3D gallery is a design choice that may not follow conventional HTML semantics. Let's delve into the specific criteria and reasons for using <span> elements in this context:

Container for Independent Elements:

Criteria: The primary reason for using <span> elements here is to create individual containers for each image. These containers allow each image to be independently manipulated in 3D space.
Reason: In a 3D gallery, each image needs to be positioned and rotated separately to create the desired 3D effect. Using <span> elements as containers facilitates this level of independent control.
Transformation and Positioning:

Criteria: 3D transformations are applied to these image containers to create the rotating and positioning effect.
Reason: Applying 3D transforms directly to <img> elements might not have the same level of control or the desired visual effect. Using the <span> elements as containers allows for precise 3D positioning and rotation of each image.
Custom Elements for Creative Design:

Criteria: In web development, it's common to use semantically meaningful elements like <div> or <figure> to structure content.
Reason: In this specific case, the use of <span> elements as custom containers is more about achieving a creative and visual effect than following strict HTML semantics. It allows the designer to have more control over the appearance of the gallery and the behavior of each image.
Compatibility and Flexibility:

Criteria: Compatibility with CSS3 3D transforms and the desired visual effect.
Reason: Using <span> elements provides the flexibility needed to apply CSS3 3D transforms to individual images, creating the 3D gallery effect. While it may not be the most semantically correct choice, it works effectively for this specific design goal.
Visual Consistency:

Criteria: Maintaining a consistent visual appearance.
Reason: Using <span> elements for all image containers ensures that each container has the same dimensions and positioning properties, contributing to a visually consistent 3D gallery.
In summary, the choice to use <span> elements in this code is primarily driven by the need for precise control over the positioning and rotation of individual images to create a 3D effect. While it may not align perfectly with HTML semantics, it's a creative solution that works effectively for this specific visual design goal. In practical web development, it's essential to strike a balance between adherence to semantics and achieving the desired visual effects.

on seeing the  product  , we can clearly see 
that the  images have reflection 
nox how the reflection is created 
using  ,
-webkit-box-reflect: below 0px
    linear-gradient(transparent, transparent, #0004);

now what you should notice about this property is 
that it says box --- reflect 

it well it does not means anything specifically 

but its a common way to create reflections  not shadows .

for shadows we have text-shadow and box shadow , alright !.




what does below 0px is saying ?

alue: below 0px
below is a keyword that specifies the direction of the reflection, which is "below" the element to which this property is applied.
0px sets the vertical offset of the reflection. In this case, it's set to 0 pixels, meaning the reflection starts directly below the element it's applied to.


and lastly     linear-gradient(transparent, transparent, #0004);
what does this saying ?
Value: linear-gradient(transparent, transparent, #0004)

linear-gradient() is a CSS function used to create gradient backgrounds. In this context, it's used to define the appearance of the reflection.
transparent is the starting color of the gradient, which is fully transparent.
transparent is the middle color of the gradient, also fully transparent. This effectively creates a transparent gap in the gradient.
#0004 is the ending color of the gradient, which is a semi-transparent black color. The #000 represents black, and the 4 in this context indicates a level of opacity, where 4 is equivalent to 40% opacity. So, it's a somewhat transparent black color.

and what does  
.box {
  transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(0deg);
}
this rotateY   is  doing and why  we declared perspective(1000px) under the transform property ?

rotateY(0deg): This part sets the initial rotation of the container around the Y-axis. In this case, it's set to 0 degrees, meaning that initially, the container is not rotated at all.

Together, they create the following effect:

The perspective(1000px) sets up the depth and perspective for the 3D space in which the container and its child elements exist.
The rotateY(0deg) initially positions the container with no rotation around the Y-axis, so it appears flat.
As a result, when elements within this container are later rotated using JavaScript (as seen in your provided script), they will appear to rotate within a 3D space with a perspective effect, giving the illusion of a 3D image gallery.

it was a very critical point to notice that the whole gallery is 
not rotating in x axis , its actually rotating in y axis .
